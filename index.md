Welcome to The Lense.

The Lense is one mans attempt to get some clarity through the act of writing. You might notice Lens is mis-spelt, that's because this isn't meant to be polished, or perfect, simply just good enough.

Whether it's any good for you is another matter... but even I find an occasional gem. I should mention, unlike some of my other writings, all posts here are safe for work. Feel free to read at your own pleasure, and if you enjoy something - feel free to share a quick blurb with friends.
