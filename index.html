        <h1>Hi there</h1>
        <!-- [//]: # "Who am I & Why do I have this website?" -->
        <p>I'm Andrew. People have called me many things over the years, but my friends tell me I'm a deep thinker, a creative and source of generally good advice.</p>
        <p>I'm very conscious of my privacy online, so I've opted out of all the social networks, but that left me with a problem. Some things I want to share with my friends, but I also don't want to pester friends with "look what I did" text messages or phone calls and even when I do share them, how do I go back to it later? It just seems a lot of hassle, so I created this site and filled it with things worthy of sharing.</p>
        
        <!-- [//]: "What immediate benefits can I give you?" -->
        <p>Right now, there isn't much on the site but I do have two recommendations for you:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you want a laugh, you might like the <a href=/hospital-thanks>thank you letter</a> I recently wrote to my local hospital.</li>
            <li>If you write on a regular basis, you might be intrigued by my <a href=/gingko-review.html>testimonial on Gingko</a>, an app that completely transformed writing from a pain to a pleasure for me.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <!-- [//]: # "How Can I Keep Updated With Your Work?" -->
        <p>If you want to keep updated with future posts, I'm sorry but I don't have a method right now. If you have a GitHub account however, you can follow any changes to the <a href=//github.com/am01264/am01264.github.io>site's code &amp; content</a>.</p>
