        <p>At first I thought $4.99/month seemed too expensive for a notepad app.</p>
        <p>What I found though, completely transformed the way I write, and the way I look at writing. Previously writing at
            any length was painful, headache inducing and just a frustrating experience of “What do I say” and “I know my
            stuff, why is this so difficult to put onto paper!?”. I can’t quite believe myself saying this, but I’m actually
            starting to enjoy writing.</p>
        <p>Being able to get a sense of the whole text at a glance, while you’re writing a specific part allows me to write
            with all of the context. I no longer need to ask “What did I say there?”, it’s in front of me, or a few key-presses
            away.</p>


        <p>Other benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting with the seed of an outline, and then fleshing it out from there is the most effortless way of writing
                I have ever encountered. This app takes this idea and makes it 3-4 times easier still.</li>
            <li>Simple navigation allows me to jump and dive across the text as fast as the ideas flow.</li>
            <li>No longer feeling scared by an empty page. I’m actually excited to get started because it’s so easy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I would recommend the Gingko app wholeheartedly to anyone who is intimidated when writing large documents, as it’s
            completely changed my experience of writing from painful to enjoyable.</p>
        <p>To finish off - a huge thank you to the creators of Gingko. I can now use a computer to write!</p>
        <p>(Previously I used a mixture of Word, Evernote, index cards and a whole empty floor, now I use Gingko for writing
            &amp; Evernote for research)</p>
