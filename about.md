Welcome to The Lense.

The Lense is one mans attempt to get some clarity through the act of writing. You might notice Lens is mis-spelt, that's because this isn't meant to be polished, or perfect, simply just good enough.

Whether it's any good for you is another matter... but even I find an occasional gem. I should mention, unlike some of my other writings, all posts here are safe for work. Feel free to read at your own pleasure, and if you enjoy something - feel free to share a quick blurb with friends.

Behind the scenes, this site is powered by a number of amazing people:

- First the site is hosted & generated by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free

- Next, the DNS was setup with 2-clicks, through my amazingly simple DNS provider, [IWantMyName.com](https://iwantmyname.com/)

- The best part, is the stellar theme [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) by @broccolini

...and then there's me, Andrew McAuley otherwise online as @am01264 doing all the writing.

I hope you enjoy the read.
