Hey &mdash;

I'm Andrew. At my best, I deliver world-class customer service and automate the <abbr title="Call it Frustration Driven Development - if something is awkward, repetitive and you keep doing it.. why not let the computer do it for you?">tedium of work</abbr> for all. 

But I'm feeling pretty human these days... I traded a teenage social life for computers - and frankly it was a bad trade, but it also gave me a 10-year head start on my peers without the pressure of conforming to a corporate environment. I can't regret it - it gave me skills.

This is my personal website - my little island in the sun. It has however, been left untouched for too long.

Feel free to peruse the site, but just know each post is of a snapshot in time - a riff on a quick idea bubbling to the surface.

...and speaking of rifts. Here's a quick credits roll...

- First the site has been kindly hosted & generated by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- Next, the DNS was setup with 2-clicks, through my surprisingly simple DNS provider, [IWantMyName.com](https://iwantmyname.com/)

- And the theme you see here desecrated, was designed in full by @broccolini, if you'd like to copy it, here's a link to the [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss).
