From the forward:
> It is a general rule in medicine that, when there are a number of different theories purporting to explain a condition, one can be certain that all of them are wrong, though each may have certain facts right. There are over four hundren different models of psycotherapy in the West today, with the proponents of each model competing with the others and laying claim to primacy. 
> ...
> Can you imagine having four hundred different schools of physics or mathematics?

The Human Givens approach is the only model I know which can be explained fully in plain english, and provides the kind of advice a good mother would give. I have explained the core of it, in a 10-minute taxi journey, it truly is a combination of clear thinking and common sense. The son of one of the authors named his company "Uncommon Knowledge", I can't think of a more apt description.

I've encountered so much written about psychology over the years, but this approach really boils psychology to it's essence... and when I look elsewhere for advice, these guiding ideas provide the glue that brings everything I know together into a practical toolkit.

Clear, Effective and Ethical. I cannot recommend this enough.
