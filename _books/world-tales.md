Not my typical reading, but a long time ago, I took a course in Hypnotherapy. There I learned the extraordinary ability of story as a teacher. Simple ideas that if stated directly, would bounce off the mind... but in the right story, the mind is absorbed, making all the connections... and making it's own ideas.

This book is an extraordinary collection of tales, and the stories of their lineage... equally fascinating. Recommended for all ages.
