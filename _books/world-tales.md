This book is the result of 35-years of research. The questions it asks, are timeless, and important to all cultures.

My personal connection with this book started after a course in Hypnotherapy[^1]. As the course went on and I applied my learnings with my partner, I learned the extraordinary ability of story as a teacher. 

I believe we have all had the frustration of seeing someone given the right advice, but are stuck in the same place. Unpromted advice often goes in one ear and out the other... but packaged in the right story, the mind is absorbed, making all the connections... and making it's own ideas. In story we have the opportunity to see the world in a whole new way, and lay down templates of what to do, and how to be.

This book is an extraordinary collection of tales, and the stories of their lineage... Unendingly fascinating and recommended for all ages.
