This book is a fascinating dive into World War 2. Not the war you know, but the war as it was discussed behind closed doors, in quiet corners. The battle of wits & daring that could never be published... until now.

I've always been curious about World War 2, but this book adds such colour and depth to the intelligence wars. Where before a museum exhibit was of interest, I now see how it links in time and place... seemingly mundane exhibits come to life as the extraordinary game of shadows behind them becomes clear.

I'm enjoying talking about it too much, but if you like your history, this is a solid book based on declassified sources the other history books never had, written like a thriller.

Could not recommend more.
