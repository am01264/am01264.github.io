This book is a fascinating dive into World War 2. Not the war you know, but the war as it was discussed behind closed doors, in quiet corners. The battle of wits & daring that could never be published... until now.

I've always been curious about World War 2, but this book adds such colour and depth to the intelligence wars, where before a museum exhibit was of interest, I now see how it links in time and place... and occasionally, I can information to the exhibit making the stories even more extraordinary.

I've enjoying talking about it too much, but if you like your history, this is a solid book based on declassified sources the other history books never had.
