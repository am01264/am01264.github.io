Someone else reviewed this with the same energy I have over this book:

> **The world will never be the same again if you read this book.**
>
> Lynne Kelly’s last book, The Memory Code, blew my mind completely. It is rare that such a book comes along which has the power to change your perspective about life on planet earth, as well as teach you a startling and ancient life skill.
>
> Well. It’s happened again...

Reading Memory Craft is like wondering down a street you've not seen in a while, everything seems so familiar... and a little alien. You'll find things you've done for years, things you've never heard of... and things that add fun to life. All while learning how to use your memory.

There are many how-to books that teach a curriculum. This book teaches a way of life.
